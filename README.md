# CS 6120 Project - Differential Transformers
In this project, we explore the proposed differential transformer and compare it to traditional transformers.

## Required Libraries:
`numpy, matplotlib, pandas, torch, datasets, sacrebleu, transformers, tqdm, scikit-learn`

## Tasks
We compared differential transformers and traditional transformers on three different tasks. Each task has its own directory with a README containing specific instructions for running the implementation for a specific task.

* __Sentiment Classification__:
  * Encoder model utilized
  * Binary and multi-class classification
  * Located in folder /Classification
  * `cd Classification`

* __Machine Translation__:
  * Encoder-Decoder model utilized
  * Located in folder /Machine-Translation
  * `cd Machine-Translation`

* __Answer-Noise Ratio Test__:
  * Decoder model utilized
  * located in folder /answer-noise-ratio
  * `cd answer-noise-ratio`

Please navigate to the desired folder using `cd` and read the README.md file in that directory to run the code!
